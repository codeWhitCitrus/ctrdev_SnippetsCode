## Future Plans

- **Versioning**: The repository will include version tags for updates, with Python code snippets being the focus in the upcoming releases.
- **Snippets Categorization**: We plan to improve the organization of code snippets by categorizing them based on topics (e.g., file handling, web scraping, etc.).

## Version History

- **v0.0.1**: Initial setup of the repository with basic code snippets.
  - Added first set of Python snippets.
  - Set up repository structure.
- **v0.0.2** (Upcoming): Python snippets release.
